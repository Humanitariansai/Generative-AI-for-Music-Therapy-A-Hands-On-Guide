# **Course Overview**

**Humanitarians AI — Generative AI for Music Therapy: A Hands-On Guide** is a community-driven, open-access educational project where volunteers—often recent graduates, students, and early-career technologists—**learn by teaching**.

This course is a **work in progress**, evolving continuously through:

* Iterative outlines shaped by contributors
* Community-created lecture content
* GitHub-hosted hands-on labs
* Real-time improvements using the **Humanitarians Courses GPT**

# **Course Structure & Pedagogy**

Each Humanitarians AI YouTube course follows a **"Learn → Build → Teach"** cycle:

1. **Start with an Outline**
   Volunteers begin with a structured outline (like the 30-chapter book outline provided here) and refine it collaboratively.

2. **Develop Hands-On Labs First**
   Before any lecture videos are recorded, the course repository includes:

   * Jupyter notebooks
   * Code labs for Suno, MusicGen, MIR, sensor integration
   * Audio datasets
   * Signal-processing demos
   * Applied therapeutic music generation workflows

3. **Use the Humanitarians Courses GPT**
   Volunteers generate:

   * Lecture scripts
   * Slides
   * Lab guides
   * Code tutorials
   * Explanations, metaphors, analogies, demos

4. **Produce YouTube Lectures**
   Once labs & notebooks are complete, volunteers record and upload:

   * Concept walkthroughs
   * Code-along music generation demos
   * Sensor-integration labs
   * Interviews with therapists and researchers

5. **Continuous Updating**
   New fellows and contributors improve the course, adding:

   * New Suno workflows
   * New therapeutic metadata examples
   * Real-time demos using wearables
   * Python feature-extraction tools

---

## **Module 3 — Musical Metadata & Computational Musicology**

Topics:

* Metadata fundamentals (BPM, mode, valence/arousal)
* Psychoacoustics
* Core MIR workflows used in clinical research

---

# **Part II — Technical Skills, Methods & Practice**

---

## **Module 4 — Generative Audio Models (Suno, MusicGen, Diffusion, DDSP)**
